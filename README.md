## Corona Virus Analysis

### The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, I have been tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present my findings.

### Dataset: Description of each column in the dataset:

1. Province: Geographic subdivision within a country/region.
2. Country/Region: Geographic entity where data is recorded.
3. Latitude: North-south position on Earth's surface.
4. Longitude: East-west position on Earth's surface.
5. Date: Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data.
6. Confirmed: Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases.
7. Deaths: Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths.
8. Recovered: Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases.

#### Analysis

- Q1. Write a code to check NULL values

- Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 

- Q3. check total number of rows

- Q4. Check what is start_date and end_date

- Q5. Number of month present in dataset

- Q6. Find monthly average for confirmed, deaths, recovered

- Q7. Find most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month 

- Q8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

- Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

- Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month

- Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case
        - (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month
        - (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

- Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case
        - (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

- Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case

- Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case

- Q16. Find top 5 countries having highest recovered case
